SEN 201 SDLC Project - Digital Queue & Waiting Time Simulator

1. Planning Phase
The Digital Queue & Waiting Time Simulator is designed to simulate how customers or clients wait in a queue in public offices such as banks or hospitals. The system helps estimate waiting time and understand queue behavior.

2. Requirements Analysis
Functional Requirements
- System should accept number of people in the queue
- System should accept average service time per person
- System should calculate waiting time
- System should display queue simulation results

Non-Functional Requirements
- System should be simple and easy to use
- System should run on a console
- System should give clear output

3. System Design
The system is designed as a console-based Python application.
It consists of:
- Input section for queue size
- Calculation logic for waiting time
- Output section for simulation results

4. Implementation
The system is implemented using Python programming language.
Variables are used to store queue size and service time, and calculations are performed to simulate waiting time.

5. Testing
The system is tested by entering different numbers of people and service times to ensure correct waiting time calculations.

6. Deployment
The program is deployed by uploading the source code to GitHub for public access.

7. Maintenance
   Future improvements may include multiple service counters, priority queues, or graphical visualization.
